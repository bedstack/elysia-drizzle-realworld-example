title: RealWorld Example
description: A full-featured, production-ready app built with Bedstack, following the RealWorld spec.
---

[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) is "the mother of all demo apps" - a specification for building a blog engine (Medium.com clone) using any combination of frontend and backend technologies.

Bedstack provides a first-class implementation of this spec in `apps/conduit`.

## Features

The Bedstack implementation includes:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth for users.
- **Profiles**: Follow/unfollow users and view profile data.
- **Articles**: Create, update, delete, and list articles with filtering (tag, author, favorited).
- **Comments**: Add and remove comments from articles.
- **Favorites**: Mark articles as favorites.
- **Tags**: List all tags used in articles.

## API Specification

Every endpoint in the `conduit` app is meticulously implemented to match the [RealWorld API specification](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/specifications/backend/endpoints/).

You can browse the interactive API documentation at [/swagger](http://localhost:3000/swagger) when running the app locally.

## Getting Started

To get the RealWorld app running locally, follow the **[Installation Guide](/docs/installation)**.

Once installed, you can run the app with:

```bash terminal
bun run dev --filter=conduit
```

## Testing for Compliance

To ensure the implementation remains 100% compliant with the spec, we use the official API test suite.

```bash terminal
bun run test:api
```

This runs a Newman/Postman collection containing hundreds of tests that validate every edge case of the specification.
