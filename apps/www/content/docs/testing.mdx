---

Bedstack leverages **Bun's built-in test runner** for fast and reliable testing.

## Running Tests

You can run tests from the root or within specific apps:

```bash terminal
# Run all tests in the monorepo
bun test

# Run tests for conduit only
bun run --cwd apps/conduit test
```

## Unit Testing

Unit tests are typically placed next to the file they are testing, using the `*.test.ts` suffix.

```typescript
// apps/conduit/src/users/users.service.test.ts
import { expect, it, describe } from "bun:test";
import { UsersService } from "./users.service";

describe("UsersService", () => {
  it("should format user correctly", () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

## API Testing

Bedstack includes the official RealWorld API test suite to ensure spec compliance.

To run the API tests:

1.  Start the database: `bun run --cwd apps/conduit db:start`
2.  Start the app: `bun run --cwd apps/conduit dev`
3.  Run the tests: `bun run --cwd apps/conduit test:api`

The `test:api` script runs a Postman/Newman collection against your running server.

## Database Tests

When testing services that interact with the database, Bedstack uses a local PostgreSQL instance (usually via Docker).

You can use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks to clean up the database between tests to ensure isolation.
